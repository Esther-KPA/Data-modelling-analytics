Business Problem Stat't : Company wants to perfom data analytics on its raw sales data to identify;
                         - Which product categories are having best and worst figures?
                         
Steps to approach:
 - Extract sales data from csv
 - Load sales data into excel using power query
 - Transform data (Using ETL operation in excel) as per business requirement
 - Build a data model
 - Build custom query to collect total sales by product category
 - Create a dashboard in excel
 
Excel power query will power this process:
** Power query is a data connection technology that enables you to discover, connect, combine and refine
   data sources to meet your analysis needs.
   
   Features of power query are available in excel and Power BI desktop.
   
** Power query steps:
Connect >> Transform >> Combine >> Share

Draw : Logical data model
pdts > Order_details > orders
 .
 Categories
 
 Reporting data model :
 
 Product_DIM (dimentional table aka Product)  -  Orders_fact (fact table aka orders)
 
 Process + Steps; "following the logical data model flow"
 
 * New query > Select cvs file > Load to > instead of table choose only create connection 
 (so that a table is not immediately created in excel) > select add data to data model
 
 * To view if all the data is loaded > Manage data model (green icon above relationsips > relationship diagram to see already
 the relationship of the data loaded > save and move on .
 
 * Go to new query > combine queries > merge > select product & categories tables (they are joined by category
 id) > select category-id (in both product & categories table) select inner join(take data from both tables based on category id)
 
 * At power query editor > Rename to Product_Dim (dimension) > in categories_sales data (also has text instead of data = table) >
  select only required data : CategoryID & CategoryName as others are not required.
  
  * Remove any columns not required within power query editor (if applicable)
  
  * Close & load to > will take you back to home > create new query > merge > select Order_details & order (as we want the name of
  of the order) > rename to :Order_fact 
  
  * Go to orders_sales data (has the word "table" in rows not data) > only select orderdate(only required)
  
  * You can duplicate the orderdate column > rename order year > transform > select year & do the same for the second duplicate into: Order month
  
  * Remove columns like discount, ordersales data colum as they wont be used
  
  * Add custom column > Go to add column > custom column > re-name > Multiply unitprice by quantity
  
  * Remove unitprice and quantity columns as well as they wont be used.
  
  * Convert order_Fact table into data model > load to > only create connection > add to data model
  
  * Join productID from Product_Dim to productID of Order_fact then create another based on this join

  * New query > OrderFact table + Product_Dim table > select productID in both tables to join the tables based on this ID >
   make it an innerjoin
   
   * Go to categoryID data > select data you want to you prdtID prdtName, catgryID, ctgryName
   
   * Remove unwanted columns and remain with categoryName & sales amount
   
   * Rename columns accordingly and aggregate the sale based on different product categories.
   (Use product sales and group by category)
   
   * Still in powerqueryeditor > Go to transform > select pdt category column > click on groupBy > change operation to SUM, rename column name > column ; totalsales
   
   * Convert total sales data into currency > sort it form descending 
   *You can view query depencies from view
